    "detailedDescription": "These idols are widely sought after for home temples and as auspicious gifts due to the material's association with purity, strength, and positive energy. Carved from natural stone, such as high-quality Makrana or Vietnam marble, each piece is designed to bring a sense of peace and divine grace to its surroundings. \nKey characteristics include:\nMaterial: Typically crafted from high-grade white or black marble, which is prized for its smooth texture, natural sheen, and durability.\nCraftsmanship: Often meticulously hand-carved by skilled artisans, featuring intricate details on the crown, ornaments, and posture.\nSymbolism: The idol's features are symbolic: large ears represent good listening skills; a small mouth for less talk; a curved trunk for adaptability; and a large belly symbolizing the peaceful digestion of all things.\nPosture and Use: Idols come in various forms (seated, standing, dancing). A seated Ganesha is typically recommended for homes to represent a calm demeanor and harmonious energy, while a standing idol is more common for businesses.\nAesthetics: The pristine white color of many marble idols is believed to reflect peace and divinity, enhancing the spiritual atmosphere of a space.
